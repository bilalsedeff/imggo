# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**imggo** - A newly initialized project. The codebase is currently minimal with only a README file.

## Repository Status

- Git repository: Initialized
- Main branch: `main`
- Current state: Early stage, no build tooling or code structure yet

## Notes for Development

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project structure, build commands, and architecture are established. Key items to add in the future:

- Build/test/lint commands once tooling is configured
- Architecture patterns and code organization principles
- API structure and data flow patterns
- Environment setup requirements
- Technology stack specifics (language, frameworks, libraries)
